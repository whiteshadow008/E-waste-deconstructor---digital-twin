## 🧠 Project Overview
E-waste contains hazardous materials and poses environmental and health risks if not handled properly. This project combines **YOLO-based object detection**, **hazard prediction**, and a **digital twin simulation** to:

✔ Identify and classify e-waste items  
✔ Predict hazardous levels  
✔ Generate automated safe deconstruction recommendations  
✔ Simulate and monitor the deconstruction workflow in real time
This solution bridges real-world deconstruction processes with simulation to improve safety and efficiency in electronic waste management. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
